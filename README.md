# Applied Security Engineering Portfolio

This repository demonstrates practical, applied expertise in Security Engineering. It contains structured notes, lab write-ups, and projects that showcase core security domains, cryptography, identity and access management (IAM), and real-world security practices. Each module reflects hands-on exercises, analysis, and evolving knowledge from personal study and professional training platforms such as TryHackMe.

## Table of Contents

**01 - Security Engineer: Day in the Life**  
Demonstrates understanding of a Security Engineer’s responsibilities, core tasks, and organizational security strategy.

**02 - Security Principles**  
Covers foundational concepts including the CIA triad, security models (Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Clark-Wilson), defense-in-depth, zero trust, and governance frameworks.

**03 - Cryptography**  
Practical coverage of symmetric and asymmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, hashing, PKI, SSL/TLS, and authentication mechanisms.

**04 - Identity & Access Management (IAM)**  
Explores authentication, authorization, accountability, access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC), multi-factor authentication, SSO, identity management, and common attacks against authentication.

**05 - Threats, Risk, and Compliance**  
Focuses on governance, regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), security standards, GRC, incident response, and risk management practices.
