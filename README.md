## Table of Contents

### 01 - Intro to Security Engineering
Understand the role of a Security Engineer, core responsibilities, continuous improvement practices, and how security fits into organizational strategy.

### 02 - Security Principles
Learn foundational concepts such as the CIA triad, security models (Bell-LaPadula, Biba, Clark-Wilson, etc.), defense-in-depth, zero trust, and governance frameworks.

### 03 - Cryptography
Covers symmetric and asymmetric encryption, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, hashing, PKI, SSL/TLS, and authentication mechanisms.

### 04 - Identity & Access Management (IAM)
Explore authentication, authorization, accountability, access control models (DAC, MAC, RBAC), multi-factor authentication, SSO, identity management, and common attacks against authentication.

### 05 - Threats, Risk, and Compliance
Covers governance, regulatory frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), security standards, GRC, incident response, and risk management best practices.
