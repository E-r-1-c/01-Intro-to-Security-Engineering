# Security Principles

## Introduction
Security principles form the foundation for protecting an organization’s digital assets. They guide system design, data protection, and risk management.

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad is the core security model:

- **Confidentiality (C):** Only authorized users can access information.
- **Integrity (I):** Ensure data is accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability (A):** Ensure systems and data are accessible when needed.

---

## DAD Model (Opposite of CIA)
Highlights threats to the CIA triad:

- **Disclosure (D):** Unauthorized access to information.
- **Alteration (A):** Unauthorized modification of data.
- **Destruction/Denial (D):** Data or service becomes unavailable.

## Fundamental Concepts of Security Models

- **Bell-LaPadula Model** (Confidentiality):
  - *No Read Up:* Users cannot read data above their clearance.
  - *No Write Down:* Users cannot write to lower security levels.
  
- **Biba Model** (Integrity):
  - *No Read Down:* Prevents contamination from lower-level data.
  - *No Write Up:* Prevents corruption of higher-level data.

- **Clark-Wilson Model** (Integrity via controlled transactions):
  - **CDIs:** Trusted data
  - **UDIs:** Untrusted input
  - **TPs:** Authorized transformation procedures
  - **IVPs:** Integrity verification procedures

- **Other Models:** Brewer-Nash, Goguen-Meseguer, Sutherland, Graham-Denning, Harrison-Ruzzo-Ullman (advanced).

## Defense-in-Depth
Use multiple overlapping layers of security:

- Prevents a single failure from compromising the system.
- Examples: firewalls, intrusion detection, access controls, encryption.

## ISO/IEC 19249

**Architectural Principles:**

- **Domain Separation:** Isolate components into secure zones.
- **Layering:** Multiple security layers.
- **Encapsulation:** Hide inner workings.
- **Redundancy:** Backup resources for availability.
- **Virtualization:** Isolate environments in virtual machines.

**Design Principles:**

- **Least Privilege:** Only give necessary access.
- **Attack Surface Minimization:** Reduce points of attack.
- **Centralized Parameter Validation:** Validate inputs in one place.
- **Centralized Security Services:** Manage critical functions centrally.
- **Prepare for Error Handling:** Fail safely during errors.

## Zero Trust vs Trust but Verify

- **Zero Trust:** Assume all entities are untrusted until verified. Continuous authentication and authorization.
- **Trust but Verify:** Assume baseline trust but monitor for violations. Often uses automated detection.

---

## Threat vs Risk

- **Vulnerability:** Weakness in the system.
- **Threat:** Something that could exploit a vulnerability.
- **Risk:** Likelihood and impact if a threat exploits a vulnerability.
